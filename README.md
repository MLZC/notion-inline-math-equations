# notion-inline-latex-equations
Inline latex rendering for math equations.
## Acknowledgement
This project is based on [Penguinlay](https://github.com/Penguinlay/notion-inline-latex) and [evertheylen](https://github.com/evertheylen/notion-inline-math) projects.
## Feature
Here I tried a different approach and render every block that is not receiving input (normally it will only be one).
## Installation
1. Download Violentmonkey for [chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag) or [firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/)
2. On the right upper corner of chrome's window click on Violentmonkey's icon
3. Click on ```Open Dashboard```
4. Click on ```New```
5. Click on ```Install from url```
6. Paste the following link and click ```Ok```
## Instructions
1. You do not need any 'normal' /math block on your page for the rendering to work
2. When you want to add some equation do it just like in latex when you add an inline equation, e.g ```$E=mc^2$```
**Note: The current block receiving input will not be rendered.**
